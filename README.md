# decimal-to-binary-basic

Code created as an example to my [Dev.to Post](https://dev.to/carlosbermejop/decimal-to-binary-and-hexadecimal-converter-on-the-apple-part-1-18nj) titled "Decimal to binary and hexadecimal converter on the Apple ][ - Part 1", in the Basic and Assembly.

To run in an emulator, load up an Apple ][ emulator and enter the following commands:

- LOAD DEC2BIN
- LIST (to validate that you can see the code being printed to the terminal)
- RUN
- Enter a number to see the result.
